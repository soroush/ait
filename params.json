{"name":"Ait","tagline":"Artificial Intelligence Toolkit","body":"# Artificial Intelligence Toolkit\r\nAIT is a C++ library aimed to provide a concrete framework for artificial\r\nintelligence research projects. It's also intended to fill the gap between\r\nacademia and industry in area of AI by providing production-quality implementation\r\nof generic AI concepts and techniques.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nAIT is based on a modular architecture by design. Each module has it's own\r\ndependencies. Currently there is one module providing a framework to model [constraint satisfaction problems](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problemâ€Ž) and solvers.\r\n\r\n### CSP Library\r\nCSP has a couple of dependencies. Dependency list depends on your needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou may either compile libAIT or download precompiled binaries. Currently a\r\ndebian package repository is maintained in\r\n[~soroush/solap](https://launchpad.net/~soroush-r/+archive/solap) ppa. Also\r\nprecompiled DLL's for Windows are available in sourceforge home page of the\r\nproject.\r\n#Compile\r\n**WARNING**: There is no support for Microsoft Visual Studio compilers. Please\r\nuse latest GNU GCC to compile this project. Earliest MSVC that's able to compile\r\nAIT, will be released in 2015. Current versions do not have capability to\r\ncompile modern C++ code. \r\n## Linux\r\n```bash\r\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
